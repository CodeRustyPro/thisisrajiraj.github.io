# Welcome to my blog!

Thank you for subscribing to my feed. I love to write for myself, but I always keep *YOU*, my reader, in mind when I write. I think about what might be meaningful, what might entertaining, and what might be useful for you to read. My blog is a collection of my personal experience, my advice on various things career, my recommendations, and more.

Here is a list of my posts hosted on this site.

<ul>
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    <li>
      <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>

If you liked something that I wrote, please be sure to let me know by [email](mailto:rajigopal@gmail.com).

If you didn't like what you read, or found something confusing - or just plain want to talk to me - feel free to write as well.

### Thank you, and hope you enjoy what I have to share!
