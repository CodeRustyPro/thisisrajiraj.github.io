# Welcome to my blog!

I love to write for myself, but 
I always keep *YOU*, my reader, 
in mind when I write. 
I think about what might be 
meaningful, 
what might entertaining, 
and what might be useful for you 
to read. My blog is a collection of my personal experience, my advice on various things career,
 my recommendations, and more.

## Thank you, and hope you enjoy what I have to share!
