    <p>There is a fragment of memory in my head from when I was six
        years old that I go back to now and then.</p>

    <p>I had just started first grade in a new school in Chennai.
        After losing my mother, I had been yanked out of my school in the countryside
        and brought to the city. My family was learning how to be happy again, in a new place. </p>

    <p>Not liking your school is not an uncommon thing in kids, but
        for me, I had extra dislike for my new school. I missed my old friends, I
        missed my mom, and I was an utter misfit in the city school. Every minute I was
        in class, I was plotting to get out of there.</p>

    <h4>Then one fine day, I made it happen. </h4>

    <p>It was 2p, we had finished lunch, and were going over English
        lessons. I went up to my teacher and told her I was not feeling well. My
        stomach hurt badly and I wanted to go home. I told her I knew how to get to my
        grandparents flat, and I will go there and rest up until my father came
        to get me. She knew that my grandparents lived nearby. She gave me permission to
        go, and I left. I found my way to my grandparents' flat. </p>

    <p>Upon arriving there, grandma let me in, asked me wash myself, and gave me a snack. 
	    I was enjoying being pampered in familiar surroundings when I heard a loud
        rap on the door. It was around 4p or 5p. Grandma sister opened the door, and my dad burst in looking
        hot and angry. He rushed into the room where I was sitting, dragged me out of the room, out of the house, down the staircase, through
        the courtyard where boys were playing cricket, and into an autorickshaw
        parked outside. He looked into my eyes, and sternly said, "Never EVER do that again".
        Emotions poured through me. I felt chastised. I was suddenly afraid. But more than anything, I 
        felt ashamed. I thought of everyone, including the boys in my grandma's flat
        that had seen me being dragged out, with tears in my eyes.</p>

    <p>Many things about this incident and the memory of it elude
        me. For example: How did my teacher let me leave the school alone? Being new in
        the city, how did I know the way to my grandma's flat? How did a little girl
        walking alone escape the notice of the many vile elements in the city? Such is
        the nature of childhood memories: you wrestle with the fragments you can recall
        and stitch the hazy snapshots into a cogent narrative with many details missing.
    </p>

    <p>But I tell you this story not just because I find
        it a fascinating episode of my life, albeit the missing details, 
        but because there is some meaning in it that I feel is worth
        exploring. 
        
<br/>
    <b><p>It was the first time in my life that I remember being brave and
        going after what I wanted with confidence.</p></b>
<br/>
	<p><h4>Let's fast forward fifteen years. </h4></p>

    <p>I was a graduate student in the University of British
        Columbia. Over my previous four years of Comp Sci education, I had become
        increasingly drawn to the field of Distributed Systems. It was a hot subject of
        the day. I had taken a class from the professor that taught Distributed Systems
        in the university, and I longed to do my thesis in it. However, when the moment
        came, I grew afraid. I thought and thought and thought, and I began to feel
        that the subject was beyond me. Everyone I knew in the Distributed Systems lab was
        WAY smarter than me. I told myself I would likely not be successful in the field.</p>

    <p>Doing my research in Distributed
        Systems would give me terrific learning, but it also presented a huge chance of
        failure. Doing research in Software Engineering or Databases, on the other hand, would be
        more up my alley and guaranteed better success. I ended up choosing what I thought was the safer path. 
        I did my thesis in Software Engineering. With the benefit of hindsight, however, I've realized that
        my analysis of my own fitness for Distributed Systems research that day was <u>plain wrong</u>. It was
        an irrational fear that I had allowed to take root in my heart and thereby miss an opportunity to do interesting
        work under a professor I  respected. </p>
<br/><br/>
    <h4>Fast forward another seventeen years. </h4>
<p>In 2018, for the first time ever, I was asked to keynote to a live audience of 30000 IT people at a Microsoft conference.</p>

    <p>Of course, it was not the most comfortable thing for me to do. Of course, my mind immediately reeled off all the ways
        in which this could go VERY VERY badly. Perhaps I would become tongue-tied and forget all English. Perhaps the demo would fail. Perhaps my nervousness would show. 
       But by now, thanks to a number of life experiences, I had learned to challenge that negative self-talk we develop over years of growing up and trying to please society. 
	    <p>There are no
        two ways about it: 
        <br/><br/>
<div style="border-style:double;border-color:black;padding:10px">
        <blockquote>To become truly who you can be, to become excellent at your job, you need to <b>be audacious</b>. You need to be willing to stick your
		neck out now and then.</blockquote>
    </div>
</p>
        <br/>
    <p>The six-year old girl that left her school that day showed
        audacity. She found what her heart desired and boldly went after it. No one taught her how to do it, nor inspired her to do it,
        she just did. Granted many things could have gone wrong
        that day. And I am not by any means advocating letting schoolchildren roam
        freely in the streets - that indeed would be an irresponsible thing to do. But that
        girl pushed the envelope of possibilities in front of her. She ventured forth, hardly
        thinking of her chances of failure. Her goal was not to impress anyone, not to show people how bold/smart/successful she was.
        Her reward was her own freedom, and she did it for the sake of it.</p>
        
        <p>Over time that same girl had learned to become more interested in playing a safe game. She started overestimating her chances
    of failure and stopped herself from doing things she truly wanted to do. Today she has once again learned the value of being bold and taking risks. She has - 
		I have - learned the importance of pursuing things, daringly, for the right reasons. But it would
		take years of life lessons to get there.  </p>
   <br/><br/> 
    <h4>I believe that as children, most of us are more free spirited than what we become as adults.</h4>
<p>
        We run around just to feel the rush of air through
        our hair, climb trees or jungle gyms, do things most adults would
        consider insane. We know how to feel alive and how to experiment. It's not that we
        don't fear the unknown - we are afraid of the dark, e.g. - but we cherish freedom, doing things for the joy of doing them,
        and trying things out for ourselves. The society
        drums that free spirit out of us. We learn to become more afraid of risks. Paradoxically, we learn to become less confident in ourselves. We
        learn to fear failure. We learn to crave approval and 'not looking bad'. We
        learn to overthink and opt for the safest path.</p>

    <p>While it is only wise to carefully evaluate
        our desires and actions, let's stop overdoing it. Our goal should be the pinnacle of whom we individually can be. To
        reach that, we need to show audacity. That audacity is
        within us. We were born with it. Let's bring it back into our lives. Let's challenge the inner voice 
        that takes us away from it. Let's not become imprisoned
        within walls of our fears. For as Theodore Roosevelt said:</p>
