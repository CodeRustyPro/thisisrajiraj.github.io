    <p>There is a fragment of memory in my head from when I was six
        years old that I go back to now and then.</p>

    <p>I had just started first grade in a new school in Chennai.
        After losing my mother, I had been yanked out of my school in the countryside
        and brought to the city. My family was learning how to be happy again, in a new place. </p>

    <p>Not liking your school is not an uncommon thing in kids, but
        for me, I had extra dislike for my new school. I missed my old friends, I
        missed my mom, and I was an utter misfit in the city school. Every minute I was
        in my class, I was plotting to get out of there.</p>

    <h2>Then one fine day, I made it happen. </h2>

    <p>It was 2p, we had finished lunch, and were going over English
        lessons. I went up to my teacher and I told her I was not feeling well. My
        stomach hurt badly and I wanted to go home. I told her I knew how to get to my
        grandparents flat, and I will go there and rest up there until my father came
        to get me. She knew that my grandparents lived nearby. She gave me permission to
        go, and I left. I found my way to my grandparents' flat. </p>

    <p>Upon arriving there and knocking on the door, I found that
        my grandparents had gone on a trip, leaving behind just my grandma's sister. My
        grandma's sister was a punctiliously orthodox Brahmin woman. Let me state
        outright that I completely disapprove of the discriminatory customs that many
        Brahmin people including my relatives practiced and continue to practice to this day. I do not approve
        of what my grandma's sister asked of me that day, and the hidden meaning behind
        it. I merely state what happened, especially because of what is about to
        happen. </p>

    <p>Grandma's sister asked me to take off all my clothes - I was
        "impure" in my school clothes having been close to non-Brahmins - wash myself,
        and then come near her. I did as she said, and as a result was sitting stark naked when I heard a loud
        rap on the door. It was around 4p or 5p. Grandma's sister opened the door, and my dad burst in looking
        hot and angry. He rushed into the room where I was sitting with a snack in front
        of me, dragged me out of the room, out of house, down the staircase, through
        the foyer where boys my age were playing cricket, and into an autorickshaw
        parked outside. He looked into my eyes, and sternly said, "Never EVER do that again".
        Emotions poured through me. I felt chastised. I was suddenly afraid. But more than anything, I 
        felt ashamed. I thought of everyone, including the boys in my grandma's flat
        that had seen me being dragged out, without a shred of clothing on me.</p>

    <p>Many things about this incident and the memory of it elude
        me. For example: How did my teacher let me leave the school alone? Being new in
        the city, how did I know the way to my grandma's flat? How did a little girl
        walking alone escape the notice of the many vile elements in the city? Such is
        the nature of childhood memories: you wrestle with the fragments you can recall
        and stitch the hazy snapshots into a cogent narrative with many details missing.
    </p>

    <p>But I tell you this story not just because I find
        it a fascinating episode of my life, albeit the missing details, 
        but because there is some meaning in it that I feel is worth
        exploring. 
        
    <h2><p>It was the first time in my life that I remember being brave and
        going after what I wanted with confidence.</p></h2>

    <p>Let's fast forward fifteen years. </p>

    <p>Many years of schooling and societal engineering had elapsed. 
        I was a graduate student in the University of British
        Columbia. Over my previous four years of Comp Sci education, I had become
        increasingly drawn to the field of Distributed Systems. It was a hot subject of
        the day. I had taken a class from the professor that taught Distributed Systems
        in the university, and I longed to do my thesis in it. However, when the moment
        came, I grew afraid. I thought and thought and thought, and I began to feel
        that the subject was beyond me. Everyone I knew in the Distributed Systems lab was
        WAY smarter than me. I told myself I would likely not be successful in the field.</p>

    <p>So I evaluated my options. Doing my research in Distributed
        Systems would give me terrific learning, but it also presented a huge chance of
        failure. Doing research in Software Engineering or Databases, on the other hand, would be
        more up my alley and guaranteed better success. I ended up choosing the safer path. 
        I did my thesis in Software Engineering. With hindsight, however, I have realized taught
        my analysis of my fitness for Distributed Systems research was plain wrong. It was
        an irrational fear, and that had caused me to miss an opportunity to do interesting
        work under a professor I intensely respected.</p>

    <h2>Now let's compare the instances.</h2>

    <p>The six-year old girl that left her school that day showed
        an enormous amount of courage. She found what her heart desired, made it her
        goal, worked up the nerve to ask her teach to let her out of school, and
        found her own way to her destination. Granted many things could have gone wrong
        that day. And I am not by any means advocating schools letting children roam
        freely in the streets - that indeed is an irresponsible thing to do. But that
        girl pushed the envelope of possibilities for her. She boldly tried, hardly
        thinking of her chances of failure and how she would *look* if she failed. </p>

    <p>I have come to believe that as children, most of us show are free spirited. 
        We run around just to feel the rush of air through
        our hair, climb trees or jungle gyms, do things most adults would
        consider insane. We know how to feel alive and how to tinker. It's not that we
        don't fear the unknown - we are afraid of the dark, e.g. - but we experiment. We
        cherish freedom and trying things out for ourselves. Over time, though, society
        drums that free spirit out of us. We learn to become more afraid of risks. We
        learn to fear failure. We learn to crave approval and 'not looking bad'. We
        learn to overthink and opt for the safest path.</p>

    <p>Let's stop a minute and bring the child-like free-spiritness and
        courage back into our lives. While it is only wise to apply our learning and carefully evaluate
        our desires and actions, let's stop overdoing it. Let's not become imprisoned
        within walls of our fears. Let's relearn the joy
        of experimenting, of daring to do things that we desire.</p>
