    When I set off on my run this morning, it was barely light. The blades of
    grass by the trail shimmered with dewdrops. A thick mist had settled in the
    valley.
</p>
<p>
    The mist was beautiful, poetic, and magical. But it also made things a little more uncertain. A
    little more dramatic. I could not see as far or as clearly as I normally
    would. As I jogged on, I began to think of a different sort of mists. The mists of
    the mental kind. Neuroscientists call them cognitive distortions. Buddhists
    call them “the veils of Maya”. 
</p>
<p>
    The Buddhist view is that we experience reality through Maya - a mist of
    perceptions and stories that we tell ourselves. Telling stories comes
    naturally to us. As the famous author Joan Didion once wrote, “We tell
    stories in order to live”. Our ancestors most certainly did just that:
</p>
<div style="text-indent:50px">
<p>
    “There is something dark and solid near the shrub. It could be a coyote. I
    should watch out.”
</p>
<p>
    “That thing on the ground looks like a snake. Don’t step on it.”
</p>
</div>
<p>
    Even if ninety-nine out of a hundred times, it turned out to be just a tree stump (not a
    coyote) or just a coil of rope (not a snake), the one time that it was not,
    that story would have saved our ancestors.
</p>
<p className="pb-5">
    Humans made sense of the uncertain and the mostly unknown world they lived in
    with the help of stories. In fact, we perceive most of reality <b>*inside*</b> our
    heads, as stories. The world is constructed for us meticulously, by
    our minds, scene by scene. This construction is influenced by various
    signals: data streaming in through our senses, our memories, our hormones,
    cultural lessons we have learned, our emotions and so on. All these
    ingredients come together as stories in our head. These stories are meant to represent
    reality…except when they do not. Many times, our stories turn out to be false: false
    alarms and false interpretations. 
</p>

<br/><br/>
<h4>
    We don’t always remember, however, that our stories are just stories, and
    can be false.
</h4>
<p>
    We react to them as though they are undeniable truths. Let me give you an
    example from my own life. A few years ago, when I had just started at
    Microsoft, I used to work with a guy whom we shall Jason. Jason was my then
    “archnemesis”. He was the proverbial pain in my neck. On many occasions,
    he would tear apart my work in code reviews and design reviews. Frequently,
    he was RUDE to me. He would blatantly reject my ideas. 
    I would seethe and fume, or feel belittled and humiliated, after EVERY
    interaction with him.
</p>
<p>
    Jason is no longer with Microsoft. That has nothing to do with me or his
    own attitude. He just no longer works here. But my point is, I made up so
many stories about why Jason did what he did (    <em>he thought I was an idiot</em>), what was going to happen to me because
of him (    <em>I’d surely get fired thanks to his public evisceration of me</em>), and
    what kind of a person Jason was (<em>he was pure evil</em>). I never
    actually spoke to him outright about any of this. I didn’t have the nerve
    to do so. I just made up stories in my head – convenient and habitual as
    such self-storytelling is. I perceived my reality as painful and stressful,
    thanks to these stories.
</p>
<p>
    In the two years Jason and I worked together, these stories caused me a lot
    of pain. Were they true? With the benefit of hindsight, I don’t think so.
    Did they help me? Perhaps a smidgen. I likely became more thorough thanks
    to the endless revising and cross-checking I did to avoid criticisms from
    Jason. But, overall, they hurt my mental health more than they helped my
    growth.
</p>
<p>
    I have had a different “Jason” – a different person that caused me an awful
    amount of stress – at different stages in my career. As ever-present and
    unescapable my dramas with these various Jason’s would seem, they would all
    inevitably pass. Often, when I became friends with someone who was once a
    Jason, I’d learn that my stories about him were woefully wrong. I was
    misguided by my stories A LOT. I was made to believe that things were more
    permanent than they were, more personal than they were, and are more
    pervasive than they were. My primal danger-alert system that had evolved to
    pick up minute signals of potential threat misfired and overreacted,
    creating more false alarms than actual signals. What’s worse, I seldom
    became aware that most of these alarms were false.
</p>
<p className="pb-10">
    To keep my stories from directing me, to lift the veils of Maya in my mind,
    I had to put in a ton of actual work. This work has included everything
    from working with a coach, to routine journaling, to practicing mindfulness
    frequently. To live peacefully and productively, you – like me - need to
    step out of your stories and get a better grip on reality.
</p>

<h4>
    You can do so with mindfulness.
</h4>

<p>
    In mindfulness practice, there is a four-step process to stop the stories
    in your head from ruling over you. It is conveniently and memorably called
    RAIN.
</p>
<p>
    1. <strong>Recognize</strong>: The first step is to recognize you are
    playing a story in your head. This story may or may not be factual. In the
    case of Jason from my earlier experience, my first step would be interrupt
    my seething and fuming, and recognize that I am in the middle of an
    elaborate movie inside my head.
</p>
<p>
    2. <strong>Allow</strong>: Then, I should allow the story and the emotions
    it creates to exist in my head. That may sound counter-intuitive, but have
    you ever tried to banish the thought of a big, fluffy panda bear by trying
    to forget about a big, fluffy panda bear? It’s the same logic. I cannot
    deal with the story effectively by trying to forget about it. I should just
    observe my fears, my humiliations, and the helplessness in my head with
    some cognitive distance.
</p>
<p>
    3. <strong>Investigate</strong>: Now I should look at the story from all
    angles. Hold it up to some mental light. Separate what appears to be facts
    from what appears to be layers of emotions surrounding the fact. Be curious
    about the shape of that story, and why it is thus. What caused me to come
    to the conclusions I came to about Jason? Can there be an alternate
    interpretation that didn’t involve me and my abilities? Can Jason just be
    pointing out facts, in his own way?
</p>
<p>
    4. <strong>Non-Identify: </strong>I know, non-identify is not an ACTUAL
    word. But the essence of this step is to detach yourself from the story in
    your head. For me, that would be to stop identifying myself with stories in
    my head about what Jason’s behavior means <em>about me</em>. I should stop
    identifying reality with the story in my head about it.
</p>
<p>
    Maya in Sanskrit means magic as well as illusions. Stories can indeed be
    magical, and cognitive illusions – false they may be - evolved for a good
    reason. The secret is to separate the harmful illusions from the inspiring
    ones. The secret is to become the master of your stories – mindfully - and
    not let them be the master of you.
